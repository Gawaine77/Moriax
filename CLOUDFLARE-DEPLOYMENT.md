# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your personal website to Cloudflare Pages, which offers fast, global hosting with a generous free tier.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. Your website files (which we just created)
3. A Cloudflare account (you already have this)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., `personal-website`)
5. Make it public (free) or private
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Upload Your Website Files

1. In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all your website files:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md`
3. Add a commit message like "Initial website upload"
4. Click "Commit changes"

### 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create a project"
4. Choose "Connect to Git"
5. Select your GitHub account and authorize Cloudflare
6. Select your `personal-website` repository
7. Click "Begin setup"

### 4. Configure Build Settings

Since this is a static website, you don't need a build process:

- **Project name**: Choose a name for your project (e.g., `my-personal-website`)
- **Production branch**: Select `main` (or `master`)
- **Framework preset**: Select "None"
- **Build command**: Leave empty
- **Build output directory**: Leave empty
- **Root directory**: Leave empty

### 5. Deploy

1. Click "Save and Deploy"
2. Wait for the deployment to complete (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
3. Your site will be available at: `https://your-project-name.pages.dev`

### 6. Connect Your Custom Domain

1. In your Cloudflare Pages project, go to "Custom domains"
2. Click "Set up a custom domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`)
4. Click "Continue"
5. Cloudflare will automatically configure the DNS records
6. Your site will now be accessible at your custom domain!

## Post-Deployment

### 1. Test Your Website

- Visit your deployed URL
- Test all sections and links
- Test on mobile devices
- Check that the contact form works

### 2. Update Content

To update your website:

1. Edit the files locally
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub
3. Cloudflare Pages will automatically redeploy

### 3. Monitor Performance

- Check your Cloudflare Analytics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**: Make sure you selected "None" for framework preset
2. **404 Errors**: Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
3. **Styling Issues**: Check that all CSS and JS files are properly linked
4. **Domain Issues**: Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
